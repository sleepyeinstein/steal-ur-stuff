# Steal Your Stuff

Using a postinstall npm script, I can invoke [npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) to a random Gist script that can steal your stuff.

It's runs this script: https://gist.github.com/tanepiper/6cb9067adca626cd2c0edbc3786dad7b

Which takes a users `.bash_history` and posts it to example.com - this could be much more malicious.
